        MISSED   — no matching running activity found on that date

    Classification rules — quality workouts (tempo, intervals, fartlek, race, strides):
        null     — full-run avg pace is unreliable (warmup/cooldown inflate avg);
                   the AI coach must classify by fetching lap data:
                   `resilio activity laps <activity_id>` (when has_laps: true)
                   or use actual_avg_pace as a caveat-flagged proxy (has_laps: false).
        MISSED   — no matching running activity found on that date

    Returns:
        dict with 'executions' list, one entry per planned workout.
        PlanError on plan-load failure.
