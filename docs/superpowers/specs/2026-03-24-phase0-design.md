# Phase 0 Design Spec — Resilio Plus Repo Setup

**Date**: 2026-03-24
**Project**: Resilio Plus — Hybrid Athlete Multi-Agent Coaching Platform
**Scope**: Phase 0 — Repository duplication, scaffold, and CLAUDE.md rewrite
**Approach**: Monorepo plat (Approach A)

---

## 1. Context

`resilio-app` is a mature Python running coach CLI (Typer + Poetry) with a functional Strava connector, VDOT calculator, training plan logic, and a rich set of Claude Code skills. Phase 0 transforms it into the starting point of a multi-agent hybrid coaching platform called **Resilio Plus**, without breaking existing functionality.

The target architecture (described in `resilio-hybrid-coach-blueprint.md`) requires:
- A FastAPI backend (new)
- A Next.js frontend (new)
- A BMAD-style multi-agent system (new)
- Preservation of the running CLI for development and debug

---

## 2. Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Repo location | `C:\Users\simon\resilio-plus` | Same level as resilio-app |
| Repo name | `resilio-plus` | Project brand name |
| CLI fate | Kept for dev/debug (Option C) | Zero regression, reuse core logic in FastAPI |
| .bmad-core/ in Phase 0 | Yes — empty scaffold with placeholders | Visible structure from day one |
| Structure | Monorepo plat (Approach A) | resilio/ untouched while backend/ built alongside |

## 4. CLAUDE.md Structure

The new `CLAUDE.md` replaces the running-coach-focused content with a hybrid multi-agent coaching context. It retains all running methodology references since they feed the Running Coach agent.

### Sections:

**1. Quick Start**
Role: Head Coach IA orchestrating 7 specialist agents. Backend FastAPI + Frontend Next.js. `resilio/` is the legacy CLI preserved for debug.

**2. Architecture Overview**
- 7 agents: Head Coach, Running, Lifting, Swimming, Biking, Nutrition, Recovery
- FatigueScore unified language (section 6 of blueprint)
- 4 API connectors: Strava (active), Hevy, FatSecret, Apple Health via Terra
- Phase map: which code lives where per phase

**3. Repository Map**
Table: folder → purpose → phase when built

**4. Agent Slash Commands** (placeholders, active in Phase 1+)
`/head-coach`, `/run-coach`, `/lift-coach`, `/swim-coach`, `/bike-coach`, `/nutrition-coach`, `/recovery-coach`

**5. Running Coach Knowledge Base**
Primary sources (4 books + supplement v2 sources):
- Daniels' Running Formula — VDOT, zones, paces → `resilio/core/vdot/`
- Pfitzinger's Advanced Marathoning — volume, periodization
- Fitzgerald's 80/20 Running — TID 80/20
- FIRST's Run Less, Run Faster — intensity over volume
- Seiler — TID best practices (IJSPP 2010)
- Durability of Running Economy (PubMed 40878015)
- Biomechanical risk factors (PMC 11532757)
- Running Biomechanics and Economy (PMC 12913831)
- Pyramidal→Polarized transition (PMC 9299127)
- ML-personalized marathon training (Scientific Reports 2025)
- Key workout protocols: long run, tempo, VO2max intervals, repetitions, progression run, tapering
- Full methodology: `docs/coaching/methodology.md` (kept intact)

**6. Development Rules**
- `resilio/` is read-only in Phase 0 (do not modify)
- New logic goes in `backend/`
- TDD mandatory (Superpowers workflow)
- CLI kept for internal debug only

**7. Key References**
- Blueprint: `C:\Users\simon\RESILIO PLUS\resilio-hybrid-coach-blueprint.md`
- Supplement v2: `C:\Users\simon\RESILIO PLUS\resilio-knowledge-supplement-v2.md`
- Execution plan: `C:\Users\simon\RESILIO PLUS\resilio-plan-execution-superpowers.md`

## 5. .bmad-core/agents/ Placeholder Format

Each `.agent.md` file created in Phase 0 follows this stub format:

```markdown
---
name: <Agent Name>
role: <one-line role>
status: placeholder — implemented in Phase 3
---

# <Agent Name>

> Full implementation in Phase 3. See resilio-hybrid-coach-blueprint.md section 5.x
> and resilio-knowledge-supplement-v2.md for knowledge base.

## Knowledge Sources
- [listed per agent from blueprint + supplement v2]

## Slash Command
/<command-name>
```

---

## 6. pyproject.toml Changes

Add to `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`:
```toml
fastapi = "^0.115.0"
uvicorn = {extras = ["standard"], version = "^0.32.0"}
httpx = "^0.28.0"
```

`resilio` CLI entry point and all existing dependencies remain unchanged. `poetry install` must pass after these additions.

---

## 7. Git Workflow

**Starting point**: Duplicate `resilio-app` → `resilio-plus` at `C:\Users\simon\resilio-plus`
**Branch**: `feat/phase0-restructure`

**Commits** (in order):
1. `chore: init resilio-plus from resilio-app` — initial duplicate, all files as-is
2. `feat: scaffold backend/, frontend/, .bmad-core/ directories` — new folders + placeholders
3. `feat: rewrite CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md for hybrid coach` — new AI instructions
4. `chore: add FastAPI and uvicorn to pyproject.toml` — dependency additions
5. `docs: update README.md for Resilio Plus`

**Invariants** (must hold after Phase 0):
- `poetry install` succeeds
- All existing tests pass (`poetry run pytest`)
- `resilio` CLI remains functional

---

## 8. Out of Scope for Phase 0

- Any code in `backend/` or `frontend/`
- Full `.agent.md` content (only stubs)
- `.bmad-core/data/` JSON files (volume-landmarks, exercise-sfr, etc.)
- `.bmad-core/tasks/`, `templates/`, `workflows/` content
- Database setup
- Any API route implementation
