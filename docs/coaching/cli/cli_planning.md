## resilio goal set

Set a goal (validates feasibility if target time provided).

**Usage:**

```bash
# Set 10K goal with target time
resilio goal set --type 10k --date 2026-06-01 --time 00:45:00

# Set half marathon goal
resilio goal set --type half_marathon --date 2026-09-15 --time 01:45:00

# Set marathon goal (no time = race goal without time)
resilio goal set --type marathon --date 2026-11-01

# General fitness goal (no date required)
resilio goal set --type general_fitness

# Non-race performance goal with horizon
resilio goal set --type 10k --horizon-weeks 12
```

**Supported race types:**

- `5k`, `10k`, `half_marathon`, `marathon`, `general_fitness`

**Returns:**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "goal": {
      "type": "10k",
      "target_date": "2026-06-01",
      "target_time": "00:45:00",
      "target_pace_per_km": "4:30",
      "vdot": 48,
      "effort_level": "competitive"
    },
    "plan_regenerated": true,
    "total_weeks": 20
  }
}
```

**What happens:**

1. Goal saved to profile
2. If a target time is provided, feasibility is assessed and returned
3. If no date is provided, a default horizon is used and a target date is derived
4. Planning workflows use this goal as input (see `resilio plan create-macro`)

---

## resilio goal validate

Re-validate the current goal feasibility without setting a new goal.

**Usage:**

```bash
resilio goal validate
```

**When to use:**

- Goal check-in mid-plan
- After illness/injury
- Before taper to confirm feasibility

---

## resilio approvals status

**Usage:**

```bash
resilio approvals approve-vdot --value 48.0
```

---

## resilio approvals approve-macro

Record macro plan approval.

**Usage:**

```bash
resilio approvals approve-macro
```

---

## resilio approvals approve-week

Record weekly plan approval with the exact JSON file path.

## resilio plan week

Get specific week(s) from the training plan without loading the entire plan.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Current week (default)
resilio plan week

# Next week
resilio plan week --next

# Specific week by number
resilio plan week --week 5

# Week containing a specific date
resilio plan week --date 2026-02-15

# Multiple consecutive weeks

```

**Parameters:**

- `--week N` - Week number (1-indexed). Takes priority over other flags.
- `--next` - Get next week instead of current week
- `--date YYYY-MM-DD` - Get week containing this date
- `--count N` - Number of consecutive weeks to return (default: 1)

**Returns:**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "message": "Week 5 of 9: build phase (2026-02-16 to 2026-02-22)",
  "data": {
    "weeks": [
      {
        "week_number": 5,
        "phase": "build",

            "pace_range_min_km": "15:59",
            "pace_range_max_km": "16:09"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "goal": {
      "type": "marathon",
      "target_date": "2026-03-28",

    }
  }
}
```

**When to use:**

- "What's my training plan for next week?" - Use `--next` flag
- "What does week 8 look like?" - Use `--week 8`
- "What training do I have mid-February?" - Use `--date 2026-02-15`
- Previewing upcoming weeks without loading entire plan
- More efficient than `resilio plan show` when you only need specific weeks

**Benefits:**

- **92% smaller output** - Returns only requested week(s), not entire plan
- **Single tool call** - No secondary file read required
- **No file I/O** - Direct data retrieval without persistence
- **Faster coaching context** - Quickly check next week during coaching sessions

---

## resilio plan template-macro

Generate a blank macro template with required fields and null placeholders.

**Usage:**

```bash
resilio plan template-macro --total-weeks 16 --out /tmp/macro_template.json
```

**Template Structure:**

The generated template includes:
- `weekly_volumes_km`: Weekly running volume targets (km)
- `target_systemic_load_au`: Total systemic load targets across ALL sports (optional)
- `workout_structure_hints`: Macro-level workout guidance per week

**Multi-Sport Planning:**

For **single-sport** athletes (running only):
- Set `target_systemic_load_au: [0.0, 0.0, ...]` (systemic load calculated later from running volume)

For **multi-sport** athletes (running + cross-training + other sports):
- Calculate total systemic load targets using `resilio analysis load`
- Set `target_systemic_load_au: [95.0, 105.0, 110.0, ...]` (total aerobic load across all sports)
- Example: Week with 45 km running (45 AU) + climbing (48 AU) + yoga (12 AU) = 105 AU total systemic load

**Notes:**
- Replace all `null` values before calling `resilio plan create-macro`
- Template is intentionally blank to keep planning decisions with the AI coach

---

## resilio plan create-macro

Generate high-level training plan structure (macro plan) with phase boundaries, volume trajectory, CTL projections, and recovery week schedule.

**Template-first flow:** generate a blank template, fill it, then create the plan.

```bash
resilio plan template-macro --total-weeks 16 --out /tmp/macro_template.json
# Fill /tmp/macro_template.json (replace nulls)
```

**Usage:**

```bash

```json
{
  "template_version": "macro_template_v1",
  "total_weeks": 4,
  "volumes_km": [null, null, null, null],
  "workout_structure_hints": [
    {"quality": {"max_sessions": null, "types": null}, "long_run": {"emphasis": null, "pct_range": [null, null]}, "intensity_balance": {"low_intensity_pct": null}},

    {"quality": {"max_sessions": null, "types": null}, "long_run": {"emphasis": null, "pct_range": [null, null]}, "intensity_balance": {"low_intensity_pct": null}}
  ]
}
```

**Returns:**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "message": "Macro plan generated for 16 weeks",
  "data": {
    "race": {
      "type": "half_marathon",
      "date": "2026-05-03",
      "target_time": "01:30:00"
    },
    "structure": {
      "total_weeks": 16,
      "phases": [
        {
          "name": "base",
          "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
          "focus": "Aerobic foundation + multi-sport integration"
        },
        {
          "name": "build",
          "weeks": [8, 9, 10, 11, 12],
          "focus": "Half marathon-specific intensity"
        },
        {
          "name": "peak",
          "weeks": [13, 14],
          "focus": "Maximum load, race-pace emphasis"
        },
        {
          "name": "taper",
          "weeks": [15, 16],
          "focus": "Reduce fatigue, peak fitness"
        }
      ]
    },
    "starting_volume_km": 25.0,
    "peak_volume_km": 55.0,
    "ctl_projections": [
      {"week": 0, "ctl": 44.0},
      {"week": 7, "ctl": 52.0},
      {"week": 12, "ctl": 58.0},
      {"week": 16, "ctl": 56.0}
    ],
    "recovery_weeks": [4, 8, 12]
  }
}
```

**What it generates:**

- **Periodization phases** - Divides plan into base/build/peak/taper with appropriate durations
- **Starting/peak volume targets** - Derived outputs (NOT inputs): starting = weekly_volumes_km[0], peak = max(weekly_volumes_km)
- **CTL projections** - Expected CTL at key milestones (+0.75/week in base/build)
- **Recovery week schedule** - Every 4th week for adaptation
- **Phase focus** - Training emphasis for each phase

**Volume Derivation:**

`starting_volume_km` and `peak_volume_km` are **derived outputs** from the `weekly_volumes_km` array in the macro template:
- `starting_volume_km = weekly_volumes_km[0]`
- `peak_volume_km = max(weekly_volumes_km)`

These fields are **outputs**, not inputs. The AI coach fills `weekly_volumes_km` in the template using guardrails, and these summary values are automatically derived during plan creation.

**When to use:**

- First step of progressive disclosure planning (generate big picture before weekly details)
- Creating structural roadmap that athlete can see and approve
- Providing starting/peak volume goals as reference for AI coach
- Establishing CTL progression goals and phase boundaries for the training cycle

---

## Weekly planning workflow (CLI)

The CLI can now scaffold a weekly JSON via `resilio plan generate-week` (it does not choose the pattern; the AI coach still decides run days, long run %, and paces).

**Typical flow:**

```bash
# 1) AI coach decides the pattern (run days, long run %, paces) and generates JSON
resilio plan generate-week \
  --week N \
  --run-days "0,2,6" \
  --long-run-day 6 \
  --long-run-pct 0.45 \
  --easy-run-paces "6:30-6:50" \
  --long-run-pace "6:30-6:50" \
  --out /tmp/weekly_plan_wN.json

# 2) Validate before presenting
resilio plan validate-week --file /tmp/weekly_plan_wN.json

# 3) Present to athlete and get approval
resilio approvals approve-week --week N --file /tmp/weekly_plan_wN.json

# 4) Persist after approval
resilio plan populate --from-json /tmp/weekly_plan_wN.json --validate
```

---

## resilio plan populate

Add or update weekly workouts in the training plan.

**Usage:**

```bash
resilio plan populate --from-json /tmp/weekly_plan_w1.json --validate
```

**Notes:**
- Safe to call repeatedly; existing weeks are preserved and updated by week_number.
- Requires weekly approval in `data/state/approvals.json` (set via `resilio approvals approve-week`).

---

## resilio plan validate-week

Validate weekly plan JSON before populating (unified validator).

**Usage:**

```bash
resilio plan validate-week --file /tmp/weekly_plan_w1.json
resilio plan validate-week --file /tmp/weekly_plan_w1.json --verbose
```

**What it checks:**
- JSON structure + required fields
- Date alignment (week start Monday, end Sunday)
- Volume accuracy + minimum workout durations
- Guardrails and safety constraints

---

## resilio plan validate-intervals

Validate interval workout structure per Daniels methodology.

**Use when:** the week includes a structured tempo/interval session with explicit work + recovery bouts.

**Usage:**

```bash
resilio plan validate-intervals \
    --type intervals \
    --intensity I-pace \
    --work-bouts work.json \
    --recovery-bouts recovery.json \
    --weekly-volume 50
```

    "type": "jog"
  }
]
```

**Daniels Rules Checked:**

- **I-pace**: 3-5min work bouts, equal recovery (jogging), total ≤10km or 8% weekly
- **T-pace**: 5-15min work bouts, 1min recovery per 5min work, total ≤10% weekly
- **R-pace**: 30-90sec work bouts, 2-3x recovery, total ≤8km or 5% weekly

**Returns:** Workout type, intensity, work/recovery bout analysis (ok/issue per bout), violations (type/severity/message/recommendation), total work volume (minutes/km), daniels_compliance (true/false), recommendations.

---

## resilio plan validate-structure

Validate training plan structure for common errors.

**Use when:** creating or revising macro plan phases/volumes (not for single-week JSON).

**Usage:**

```bash
resilio plan validate-structure \
    --total-weeks 20 \
    --goal-type half_marathon \
    --phases phases.json \
    --weekly-volumes volumes.json \
    --recovery-weeks recovery.json \

```

**Input JSON Format (recovery.json):**

```json
[4, 8, 12, 16]
```

**Checks Performed:**

- **Phase duration**: Base/build/peak/taper weeks appropriate for goal type
- **Volume progression**: Average weekly increase ≤10% (10% rule)
- **Peak placement**: Peak week 2-3 weeks before race
- **Recovery frequency**: Recovery weeks every 3-4 weeks
- **Taper structure**: Gradual volume reduction (70%, 50%, 30% for 3-week taper)

**Returns:** Total weeks, goal type, phase duration checks, volume progression check, peak placement check, recovery week check, taper structure check, violations, overall_quality_score (0-100), recommendations.

---

## resilio plan export-structure

```

---

## resilio plan week-execution

Analyse planned vs actual execution for a specific training week.

Matches each planned workout to an actual Strava activity by date and sport type,
then classifies execution quality. Used in the `weekly-plan-generate` workflow
(Step 2b) to gate quality progression decisions.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Analyse Week 5 execution before generating Week 6
resilio plan week-execution --week 5

# Analyse Week 4 (recovery week) to confirm reduced load
resilio plan week-execution --week 4
```

**Classification rules:**

| Class | Criteria |
|---|---|
| CLEAN | Pace within range, HR within range, completion ≥ 90% |
| STRUGGLED | Pace above ceiling, HR spiked, or session cut short (<90%) |
| EASY | Pace well below floor (>20 sec/km under) AND HR below lower bound |
| MISSED | No running activity found on that date |

**Returns:**

```json
{
  "week_number": 5,
  "start_date": "2026-02-16",
  "end_date": "2026-02-22",
  "workouts_analyzed": 4,
  "summary": {"clean": 3, "struggled": 0, "easy": 0, "missed": 1},
  "executions": [
    {
      "workout_id": "w_614622b4",
      "date": "2026-02-19",
      "workout_type": "tempo",
      "planned_distance_km": 9.0,
      "planned_pace_range": "5:02-5:14",
      "activity_id": "strava_123456789",
      "matched": true,
      "day_shifted": false,
      "actual_date": null,
      "actual_distance_km": 8.9,
      "actual_avg_pace": "5:08",
      "actual_avg_hr": 172,
      "completion_pct": 99,
      "classification": "CLEAN",
      "classification_reason": "pace 5:08/km (target 5:02–5:14) HR 172bpm (target 169–179) completion 99%"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Typical use in quality progression (Step 2b)**:

```bash
# Before generating Week 6, check Week 5 quality execution
resilio plan week-execution --week 5
# Use classification to decide: CLEAN → PROGRESS, STRUGGLED → MAINTAIN
```

**Day-shift handling**: Activities are matched across the full Mon–Sun window, not just
the planned date. A Wednesday run done on Thursday will be detected and classified with
`"day_shifted": true` rather than marked MISSED. Distance proximity (±50%) prevents
mismatching a 6km easy run with a 17km long run on a different day.

**Note**: Requires activities to be synced (`resilio sync`). If workouts are still
`status: scheduled` (future), all will return MISSED — this is expected.
