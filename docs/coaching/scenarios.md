# Coaching Scenarios Reference

Detailed examples of common coaching workflows using the Resilio CLI.

## Scenario 1: First Session with New Athlete (AUTH-FIRST PATTERN)

```bash
# STEP 0: Check auth status FIRST (mandatory)
resilio auth status

# If not authenticated or token expired:
if [ $? -eq 3 ]; then
  # Guide user through OAuth flow
  echo "Let's connect your Strava account so I can access your training history."
  resilio auth url
  # User opens browser, authorizes, copies code
  resilio auth exchange --code CODE_FROM_URL
fi

# STEP 1: Now sync activities (this is why auth was required first)
resilio sync  # Imports 12+ weeks of history → provides CTL/ATL/TSB baseline

# STEP 2: Review historical data to inform profile setup
resilio week    # See recent training patterns and activities
resilio status  # Get baseline metrics (CTL will be non-zero with history)

# STEP 3: Set up profile with context from historical data
resilio profile get  # Check if profile exists

# Now you can ask refined questions based on actual data:
# "I see you average 35km/week - should we maintain this volume?"
# "Your recent activities show climbing Tuesdays - is this consistent?"
# vs generic "How much do you run?" without any context

# STEP 4: Set goal and generate plan
resilio goal set --type 10k --date 2026-06-01
```

### Detailed Profile Setup Conversation Example

After auth + sync, here's how to collect profile data using natural conversation:

```
# STEP 3a: Collect basic info via natural conversation
# (NOT AskUserQuestion - these are free-form text/number inputs)

Coach: "I can see your training history now. Let's set up your profile. What's your name?"
Athlete: "Alex"

Coach: "Nice to meet you, Alex! How old are you?"
Athlete: "32"

Coach: "Perfect. Looking at your Strava data, your resting HR averages around 55. Do you know your max heart rate?"
Athlete: "Yeah, I tested it last month - it's about 190"

Coach: "Great, that helps with zone calculations. I notice you do climbing and running. Which is your primary sport?"
Athlete: "I'd say they're equal - I'm equally committed to both"

# STEP 3b: Now use AskUserQuestion for policy decision
# (This IS appropriate - distinct options with trade-offs)

Coach: "When there's a conflict between running and climbing - like a long run and a climbing comp on the same day - how should I handle it?"

[Use AskUserQuestion with options]
A) Ask me each time (most flexible)
   - I'll present options and trade-offs for each conflict
   - You decide based on current priorities and how you feel
   - Best for athletes with variable schedules

B) Climbing wins by default (protect primary sport)
   - Running workouts get adjusted around climbing schedule
   - Running plan adapts to accommodate climbing commitments
   - Best for competitive climbers in season

C) Running goal wins (prioritize race prep)
   - Keep key running workouts unless injury risk
   - Climbing scheduled around critical runs
   - Best when training for a specific race

Athlete: "Ask me each time - my priorities shift depending on the week"

# STEP 3c: Save profile
resilio profile set --name "Alex" --age 32 --max-hr 190 --conflict-policy ask_each_time

Coach: "Perfect! Your profile is set up. Now let's talk about your running goal..."
```

**Key Takeaways**:
- ✅ Names, ages, HR values → Natural conversation (text/number input)
- ✅ Sport priority → Natural conversation works here too ("equal")
- ✅ Conflict policy → AskUserQuestion is PERFECT (decision with trade-offs)
- ❌ NEVER: "AskUserQuestion: What's your name? Options: A) Tell me B) Skip"

### Injury History - Context-Aware Questioning

The AI coach should adapt the injury question based on observed activity patterns from the computational tools.

#### Detection Methods

**1. Activity Gap Detection**:
- Via `resilio status`: CTL drop from 45→20 over 3 weeks
- Via `resilio week`: 14+ day gap between activities
- Via activity dates: Compare timestamps for gaps

**2. Injury Keywords in Notes**:
- The `flags` field in daily metrics automatically extracts injury/illness keywords
- Keywords: pain, sore, injury, hurt, ache, strain, etc.
- Example: flags = ["run activity: pain, sore"]

**3. CTL/ATL Anomalies**:
- Sudden CTL drops not explained by planned rest
- ATL spike followed by extended low-load period

#### Adaptive Question Patterns

**If activity gap detected**:
```
"I noticed you had a break from running in November. Was that due to injury?"
```

**If activity notes mention pain**:
```
"I see some notes about knee discomfort in your recent activities.
Can you tell me about that injury history?"
```

**If no signals detected**:
```
"Any past injuries I should know about? Helps me watch for warning signs
and adjust training load appropriately."
```

#### Follow-Up Questions

Always ask if recent/ongoing:
```
"Is that fully healed or something to monitor during training?"
```

#### Storage Format

Store exactly as athlete describes - don't sanitize or categorize:

✅ **Good**:
- "Left knee tendonitis 2023, fully healed"
- "Right Achilles tightness if I run 3 days in a row"
- "Took break Nov 2025 - knee pain, better now but watch mileage"

❌ **Bad**:
- "Knee injury" (too vague)
- "Healed tendonitis" (lost context)
- Categorizing into "major" vs "minor" (subjective)

#### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Check for activity gaps
resilio status  # Look for CTL drops
resilio week    # Review recent activity density

# 2. If gap detected, ask context-aware question
Coach: "I noticed your CTL dropped from 44 to 22 in mid-November.
       Was that a planned break or due to injury?"
Coach: "Quick note: CTL is your long-term training load—think of it as your 6-week fitness trend. For multi-sport athletes, it reflects total work across running + other sports."

Athlete: "Actually, I had some left knee pain. Took a few weeks off."

# 3. Follow up on current status
Coach: "Thanks for letting me know. Is that fully healed now,
       or something I should watch for?"

Athlete: "It's better, but it can flare up if I increase mileage too quickly."

# 4. Store detailed history
resilio profile set --injury-history "Left knee pain Nov 2025, healed but watch mileage progression"
```

**📊 WHY AUTH FIRST:**

- Provides 12+ weeks of activity history for baseline CTL/ATL/TSB calculations
- Enables intelligent profile setup questions based on actual training patterns
- Reveals multi-sport activities for accurate load management
- Without auth: coaching starts blind with CTL=0 and generic defaults
- With auth: "I see your CTL is 44 (solid recreational level)" vs "Let's start from zero"

## Scenario 2: Daily Coaching Check-in

```bash
# Get today's workout with full context
resilio today
# Returns: workout, current_metrics, adaptation_triggers, rationale

# Claude Code can now coach based on:
# - Workout details (type, duration, pace zones)
# - Current metrics (CTL, TSB, ACWR, readiness)
# - Any triggers (ACWR elevated, readiness low, etc.)
```

**Coaching Approach:**

- Reference actual metrics when explaining recommendations
- If triggers detected, use AskUserQuestion to present options
- Explain trade-offs: "ACWR 1.35 (caution) + yesterday's climbing (340 AU) → easy run, move tempo, or proceed?"
- Quick defs (first mention only): ACWR compares this week to your recent average; high values mean a sudden spike. Readiness is a recovery score—higher usually means you can handle harder work. For multi-sport athletes, these reflect total work across running + other sports.

## Scenario 3: Weekly Review

```bash
# Get full week summary (includes plan if exists)
resilio week
# Returns: planned_workouts_detail (workouts if plan exists, null otherwise), completed activities, metrics, changes

# Sync latest if needed
resilio sync --since 7d

# Check current state
resilio status
```

**Analysis Decision:**

- **If `planned_workouts_detail` exists** → Use adherence analysis:
  - Map planned workouts to actual activities by date
  - Flag: Missed workouts, day shifts, volume variance (>15%), quality downgrades
  - Assess: Completion rate, volume adherence, intensity compliance

- **If `planned_workouts_detail` is null** → Use freeform analysis:
  - List activities by date/sport/volume
  - Compare to 4-week rolling average
  - Check: Consistency, goal alignment, intensity distribution

**Analysis Points:**
- Compare planned vs completed workouts (if plan exists)
- Review total training load (systemic + lower-body across all sports)
- Check metric trends (CTL/ATL/TSB progression, ACWR load spikes)
- Identify patterns: consistency, intensity distribution, recovery adequacy

## Scenario 4: Goal Change

```bash
# Set new goal (stored in profile; use macro planning flow to generate plan)
resilio goal set --type half_marathon --date 2026-09-15 --time 01:45:00

# View new plan
resilio plan show
# Returns: All weeks with phases, workouts, volume progression
```

**Interactive Plan Presentation:**

1. Use toolkit to design plan based on new goal
2. Create markdown file with full plan structure
3. Present for review: phases, volume progression, constraints
4. Save to YAML only after athlete approves

## Scenario 5: Profile Updates

```bash
# Update basic info
resilio profile set --name "Alex" --age 32 --max-hr 190

# Update training preferences
resilio profile set --run-priority primary --conflict-policy ask_each_time
```

**When to Update Profile:**

- After race performance (update VDOT from PR)
- Changed training availability (work schedule, life events)
- New multi-sport priorities (e.g., climbing season starting)
- Discovered preferences through coaching conversation

## Scenario 6: Handling Adaptation Triggers

```bash
# Get today's workout and check for triggers
result=$(resilio today)

# Parse triggers
triggers=$(echo "$result" | jq -r '.data.adaptation_triggers')

# If triggers exist, present options using AskUserQuestion
# Example: ACWR elevated + low readiness
```

**Response Pattern:**

```
Quick defs (first mention only): ACWR compares this week to your recent average; high values mean a sudden spike. Readiness is a recovery score—higher usually means you can handle harder work. For multi-sport athletes, these reflect total work across running + other sports.
Your ACWR is 1.35 (slightly elevated) and readiness is 45 (low).
Tempo run scheduled today. What would you prefer?

A) Easy 30min run (safest) - maintains aerobic base, ACWR stays manageable
B) Move tempo to Thursday - 2 extra recovery days
C) Proceed as planned - moderate risk (~15% risk index)
```

## Scenario 7: Plan Regeneration After Injury

```bash
# After injury recovery, assess current fitness
resilio status  # Check CTL drop during recovery

# Sync recent activities to understand training interruption
resilio sync --since 30d

# Regenerate plan with conservative restart
resilio goal set --type [same_goal] --date [adjusted_date]

# Present updated plan for review
# Adjust phases: longer base rebuild, shorter peak
```

**Coaching Considerations:**

- CTL will have dropped during recovery - use new CTL as baseline
- Volume restart: 50-70% of pre-injury volume
- Gradual ramp: slower progression than initial plan
- Monitor triggers closely: ACWR, readiness, injury/illness flags

## Scenario 8: Multi-Sport Conflict Resolution

```bash
# Check upcoming week's plan
resilio week

# Athlete mentions: "I have a climbing competition Saturday"
# Review lower-body load implications

# Use AskUserQuestion to resolve conflict
```

**Conflict Resolution Pattern:**

```
I see you have a long run Saturday (18km, 90min).
You mentioned a climbing competition that day.

Options:
A) Move long run to Sunday - fresh legs for competition
B) Downgrade Saturday to easy 30min - light stimulus, legs ready
C) Skip Saturday run - prioritize competition (equal priority policy)

Based on your "equal priority" policy, I'm leaning toward A or B.
```

## Scenario 9: Race Week Preparation

```bash
# 1 week before race
resilio today --date [race_date - 7 days]

# Check taper plan
resilio week

# Verify readiness trends
resilio status
```

**Race Week Coaching:**

- Confirm TSB is moving toward +5 to +15 (race ready zone)
- Verify taper is reducing volume (typically 70% → 50% → 30%)
- Check readiness score (should be trending up to 70-85+)
- Remind about rest, nutrition, logistics

## Scenario 10: Post-Race Recovery

```bash
# Day after race - check status
resilio status  # TSB will be very negative

# Recommend recovery period based on race distance:
# - 5K: 3-5 days easy
# - 10K: 5-7 days easy
# - Half: 7-10 days easy
# - Marathon: 14-21 days easy + full recovery week

# Monitor readiness and injury/illness flags
resilio week  # Track recovery progression
```

**Recovery Coaching:**

- Force easy pace regardless of how athlete feels
- Watch for readiness to return to >60 before resuming quality work
- Use multi-sport activities wisely: yoga, easy cycling OK; climbing/HIIT not OK
- New goal setting: wait until readiness stabilizes

## Scenario 11: Pre-Plan Constraints Discussion (BEFORE Plan Generation)

**Context**: After profile setup and goal setting, BEFORE calling `resilio plan regen`

**Why This Matters**:
- Generic defaults (2-4 runs/week, all 7 days available, 90min sessions) don't reflect reality
- Plan design requires knowing actual schedule constraints
- Long runs >90min essential for marathon training - must confirm athlete can do them
- Other sport commitments must be locked in before workout placement

**What Happens if Skipped**:
- Plan assigns runs to days athlete can't train
- Long runs capped at 90min when athlete could do 3 hours
- Conflicts with other sports not managed → athlete manually moves workouts weekly (bad UX)

### Conversation Pattern

**Constraints to Discuss**:

1. **Run frequency**: "How many runs per week are realistic for you?"
2. **Unavailable days**: "Any days you absolutely cannot run? Work, family, other sports?"
3. **Session duration**: "What's the longest run you can do? Marathon training means 2-3hr long runs."
4. **Other sport commitments**: "How many times per week do you climb? Any days you can't do that sport?"
5. **Time of day**: "Morning or evening runs? Any preference?"

### Example Dialogue

```
Coach: "Before I design your marathon plan, let me understand your schedule.
       How many runs per week are realistic?"

Athlete: "I can do 3-4 runs consistently. Maybe 5 on a good week, but let's plan for 4."

Coach: "Perfect, 4 runs/week is solid for marathon training. Any days you cannot run?
       I know you climb - how many sessions per week, and any days you can't climb?"

Athlete: "I climb twice a week. I can’t climb Sundays. For running, I can’t run on Monday or Wednesday."

Coach: "Got it. I’ll avoid Monday and Wednesday for runs. We’ll keep climbing at 2x/week and not schedule it on Sundays."

Athlete: "Yes, that's ideal."

Coach: "One more thing - what's the longest run you can do? Marathon training
       means long runs of 2-3 hours eventually."

Athlete: "Weekends I can do 2-3 hours no problem. Weekdays max 90 minutes."

Coach: "Excellent! Let me update your profile with these constraints."
```

### Update Profile with Constraints

```bash
resilio profile set \
  --min-run-days 4 \
  --max-run-days 4 \
  --unavailable-days "monday,wednesday,friday" \
  --max-session-minutes 120
```

### Common Constraint Patterns

| Athlete Type | Run Days/Week | Unavailable Days | Max Session | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Full-time worker, climbing Fridays | 4 | Fri | 180min weekend | Protect Friday climbing |
| Parent, evenings only | 3 | Tue, Thu, Sun | 120min | Early morning long run Saturday |
| Multi-sport (cycling Sat) | 3-4 | Tue, Fri, Sat | 90min weekday, 150min Sun | Sunday long run only |
| Flexible schedule | 4-5 | None | 180min | Optimize for recovery |

### Integration with Conflict Policy

Constraints + conflict policy = complete scheduling system:

- **Constraints**: Define WHEN athlete CANNOT run
- **Conflict policy**: Define WHAT HAPPENS when conflicts arise in remaining available days

Example:
- Constraint: "Cannot run Mon/Wed, Friday climbing"
- Conflict policy: "ask_each_time"
- Result: Coach proposes runs on available days, asks when conflicts occur within those days

### Workflow Position

**Correct Flow**:
1. Profile setup (basic info, sport priorities, conflict policy)
2. **→ THIS SCENARIO: Constraints discussion** ←
3. Goal setting
4. Plan skeleton generation (`resilio plan regen`)
5. Plan design (weekly structure)
6. Plan presentation and approval

---

## Scenario 12: Weekly Planning Transition Workflow

**Context**: Athlete has completed Week 1 of their training plan. Time to analyze the week and generate Week 2 workouts using the progressive disclosure workflow.

**Why This Matters**:
- **Adaptive planning**: Each week is tailored based on actual training response, not rigid advance planning
- **Reduced errors**: Smaller scope (1 week vs 4 weeks) = fewer date/calculation mistakes
- **Natural coaching rhythm**: Weekly check-ins + weekly planning = seamless coaching experience
- **Authentic coaching**: Real coaches plan week-by-week based on athlete response

**Progressive Disclosure Principle**:
- Macro plan (16 weeks) provides structure: phases, volume targets, CTL projections
- Weekly plan (1 week) provides execution: detailed workouts with exact distances, paces, purposes
- Each week generated AFTER previous week completes → informed by actual adherence, fatigue, adaptation

### Workflow: Weekly Analysis → Weekly Planning

```bash
# ========================================
# PART 1: Analyze Completed Week (Week 1)
# ========================================

# Check what week we just completed
resilio dates today
# Returns: {"date": "2026-01-26", "day_name": "Sunday", "week_boundary": "end"}

# Get weekly summary
resilio week
# Shows: Week 1 (Jan 20-26), 4 workouts, 23 km total

# Optional: Analyze intensity distribution if you have activities JSON
# resilio analysis intensity --activities /tmp/activities_7d.json --days 7
# Returns: 82% easy, 18% hard (good 80/20 compliance)

# Check current metrics (post-week-1)
resilio status
# Returns: CTL 46.2 (+2.2 from 44.0), ACWR 1.05 (safe), readiness 72 (good)

# ========================================
# PART 2: Weekly Analysis Interpretation
# ========================================

# Coach analyzes results:
# ✓ Completion: 4/4 runs completed - excellent
# ✓ Intensity: 82% easy, 18% hard - good 80/20 discipline
# ✓ CTL progression: +2.2 points (target was +2.0) - on track
# ✓ ACWR: 1.05 (safe zone) - no load spike
# ✓ Readiness: 72 (good) - ready for next week's progression
# ✓ Activity notes: No pain/injury keywords detected

# Conclusion: Athlete handled Week 1 well → proceed with Week 2 as planned

# ========================================
# PART 3: Check Macro Plan for Week 2
# ========================================

# Load macro plan to see Week 2 target
resilio plan show --format json | jq '.weeks[] | select(.week_number == 2)'
# Returns:
# {
#   "week_number": 2,
#   "phase": "base",
#   "start_date": "2026-01-27",
#   "end_date": "2026-02-02",
#   "target_volume_km": 26.0,
#   "workout_structure_hints": {
#     "quality": {"max_sessions": 1, "types": ["strides_only"]},
#     "long_run": {"emphasis": "steady", "pct_range": [24, 30]},
#     "intensity_balance": {"low_intensity_pct": 0.90}
#   },
#   "is_recovery_week": false
#   // NO workout_pattern - this is macro plan (structure only + hints)
# }

# ========================================
# PART 4: Assess if Volume Adjustment Needed
# ========================================

# Decision logic:
# - Adherence 100% → no downgrade needed
# - ACWR 1.05 (safe) → no load spike
# - Readiness 72 (good) → can handle progression
# - No illness/injury signals → proceed as planned
# → Use volume_adjustment = 1.0 (no change from macro target)

# If athlete had struggled:
# - Adherence <80% → consider 0.95 adjustment
# - ACWR >1.3 → consider 0.9 adjustment
# - Readiness <50 → consider skipping week or 0.85 adjustment

# ========================================
# PART 5: Recalibrate VDOT if Needed
# ========================================

# Check if VDOT recalibration needed:
# - Recent race result? No
# - Breakthrough workout? No (Week 1 was all easy runs)
# - Consistent pace improvements? Too early (only 1 week)
# → Keep VDOT at 48.0 (no recalibration)

# If there WAS a signal:
# resilio vdot calculate --race-type 10k --time 42:00
# resilio vdot paces --vdot 49

# ========================================
# PART 6: Generate Week 2 Workouts
# ========================================

# Generate detailed workouts for Week 2
resilio plan generate-week \
  --week 2 \
  --run-days "0,2,4,5" \
  --long-run-day 5 \
  --long-run-pct 0.45 \
  --easy-run-paces "6:15-6:45" \
  --long-run-pace "6:15-6:45" \
  --out /tmp/weekly_plan_w2.json

# Returns:
# {
#   "ok": true,
#   "message": "Weekly plan JSON generated for week 2",
#   "data": {
#     "week_number": 2,
#     "file": "/tmp/weekly_plan_w2.json",
#     "phase": "base",
#     "target_volume_km": 26.0
#   }
# }

# ========================================
# PART 7: Validate Week 2 Plan
# ========================================

# Validate BEFORE presenting to athlete
resilio plan validate-week --file /tmp/weekly_plan_w2.json

# Returns:
# {
#   "ok": true,
#   "message": "Weekly plan validated: 0 errors, 0 warnings",
#   "data": {
#     "overall_ok": true,
#     "violations": [],
#     "warnings": [],
#     "summary": {
#       "weeks_checked": 1,
#       "critical_issues": 0,
#       "warnings": 0,
#       "volume_accuracy": "100.0%",
#       "minimum_duration_compliance": "100%"
#     }
#   }
# }

# ✓ Validation passed - safe to present

# ========================================
# PART 8: Present Week 2 to Athlete
# ========================================
```

**Coach presents to athlete**:

```
"Great week! You completed all 4 runs and maintained excellent 80/20 intensity
distribution. Your CTL increased by 2.2 points to 46.2 - right on target.
Quick defs (first mention only): CTL is your long-term training load—think of it as your 6-week fitness trend. ACWR compares this week to your recent average; high values mean a sudden spike. Readiness is a recovery score—higher usually means you can handle harder work. For multi-sport athletes, these reflect total work across running + other sports.
ACWR is 1.05 (safe zone) and your readiness score is 72 (good), so you're
ready for Week 2's progression.

Here's your Week 2 plan (Jan 27 - Feb 2):

**Volume**: 26 km (+13% from Week 1)
**Structure**: 3 easy runs + 1 long run
**Phase**: Base (aerobic foundation)

**Workouts**:
- Monday: Easy run (4.5 km, 31 min, 6:15-6:45 pace) - Recovery from long run
- Wednesday: Easy run (5.0 km, 34 min, 6:15-6:45 pace) - Midweek maintenance
- Friday: Easy run (4.5 km, 31 min, 6:15-6:45 pace) - Pre-long run freshness
- Saturday: Long run (12.0 km, 72 min, 6:15-6:45 pace) - Build endurance

**Key Points**:
- Volume increases 13% (within safe 10-15% range)
- All runs at E-pace (conversational) - continue building aerobic base
- Long run increases from 10.5 km → 12.0 km (progressive overload)
- Rest days: Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday (recovery + climbing schedule)

Does this look good to you? Any adjustments needed?"
```

**Athlete**: "Looks perfect! Let's do it."

```bash
# ========================================
# PART 9: Save Week 2 Plan
# ========================================

# After athlete approval, save to system
resilio approvals approve-week --week 2 --file /tmp/weekly_plan_w2.json
resilio plan populate --from-json /tmp/weekly_plan_w2.json --validate

# Returns:
# {
#   "ok": true,
#   "message": "Training plan populated with 1 week",
#   "data": {
#     "weeks_added": 1,
#     "workouts_added": 4,
#     "date_range": "2026-01-27 to 2026-02-02"
#   }
# }

# Week 2 now available for daily coaching
resilio today  # Will show Monday's workout (4.5 km easy run)

# ========================================
# PART 10: Repeat Next Week
# ========================================

# After Week 2 completes (Feb 2), repeat this workflow:
# 1. Analyze Week 2 completion (`resilio week`), intensity, CTL progression
# 2. Check macro plan for Week 3 target
# 3. Assess volume adjustment (did athlete struggle? Need downgrade?)
# 4. Recalibrate VDOT if performance breakthrough
# 5. Generate Week 3 workouts
# 6. Validate
# 7. Present
# 8. Approve + save after approval
```

### Alternative Scenarios Within Workflow

#### Scenario A: Volume Adjustment Needed (Athlete Struggled)

```bash
# After Week 2 analysis:
# - Completion: 75% (3/4 runs completed)
# - ACWR: 1.42 (elevated load spike)
# - Readiness: 48 (low)
# - Activity notes: "felt tired all week"

# Decision: Reduce Week 3 volume by 10%
resilio plan generate-week \
  --week 3 \
  --run-days "0,2,4,6" \
  --long-run-day 6 \
  --long-run-pct 0.45 \
  --easy-run-paces "6:20-6:50" \
  --long-run-pace "6:20-6:50" \
  --out /tmp/weekly_plan_w3.json

# Macro target: 30 km → Adjusted target: 27 km
```

**Coach explains**:
```
"I noticed Week 2 was tough - you missed one run and noted feeling tired.
Your ACWR jumped to 1.42 (elevated load spike) and readiness is 48 (low).

Let's reduce Week 3 volume by 10% to let your body catch up. Instead of
30 km, we'll do 27 km - still progressing, but more conservatively.

This is exactly what adaptive planning is for!"
```

#### Scenario B: VDOT Recalibration (Breakthrough Performance)

```bash
# During Week 4, athlete runs a 10K race: 42:00 (previous estimate was 45:00)

# Recalibrate VDOT
resilio vdot calculate --race-type 10k --time 42:00
# Returns: VDOT 49.0 (was 48.0)

resilio vdot paces --vdot 49
# Get new training paces (all ~5 sec/km faster)

# Generate Week 5 with updated VDOT
resilio plan generate-week \
  --week 5 \
  --run-days "0,2,4,6" \
  --long-run-day 6 \
  --long-run-pct 0.45 \
  --easy-run-paces "6:10-6:40" \
  --long-run-pace "6:10-6:40" \
  --out /tmp/weekly_plan_w5.json
```

**Coach explains**:
```
"Congratulations on that 10K! 42:00 is a significant breakthrough - your
VDOT is a running fitness score based on your recent race or hard-effort times. I use it to set your training paces so your running stays matched to your current fitness alongside your other sports.
VDOT is now 49 (up from 48). This means your training paces will be about
5 seconds per km faster going forward.

New E-pace: 6:10-6:40 (was 6:15-6:45)
New T-pace: 4:50-5:05 (was 4:55-5:10)

Week 5 workouts will reflect these updated paces. Your fitness is improving!"
```

#### Scenario C: Schedule Conflict (Need to Adjust Run Days)

```bash
# Athlete: "I have a work trip Thursday-Friday next week, can we shift workouts?"

# Option 1: Regenerate with profile update
resilio profile set --unavailable-days "wednesday,thursday,friday"  # Keep Mon/Tue/Sat/Sun

resilio plan generate-week \
  --week 5 \
  --run-days "0,1,5,6" \
  --long-run-day 6 \
  --long-run-pct 0.45 \
  --easy-run-paces "6:10-6:40" \
  --long-run-pace "6:10-6:40" \
  --out /tmp/weekly_plan_w5.json

# System generates workouts only on Mon, Tue, Sat, Sun

# Option 2: Manually move workouts (for one-time change)
# Coach: "Let's move Thursday's easy run to Wednesday instead"
```

### Key Benefits of Weekly Planning

1. **Maximum adaptability**: Respond immediately to illness, injury, schedule changes
2. **Reduced errors**: 7 days vs 28 days = 75% fewer dates to calculate
3. **Natural coaching rhythm**: Weekly check-ins already happen → seamless integration
4. **Authentic coaching**: Real coaches don't plan 4 weeks in advance rigidly
5. **Data-informed decisions**: Each week uses most recent CTL, ACWR, readiness, adherence

### Macro Plan Still Provides Structure

The 16-week macro plan remains critical:
- **Phase boundaries**: When to introduce tempo runs, intervals, peak volume, taper
- **Volume trajectory**: Where we're headed (23 km → 55 km → 18 km)
- **CTL projections**: Expected fitness at key milestones
- **Recovery week schedule**: Every 4th week at 70% volume

**Weekly planning executes the macro structure with real-time adaptation.**

### Integration with weekly-analysis Skill

The `weekly-analysis` skill includes Steps 8-14 for seamless weekly planning:
- Step 8: Check macro plan for next week
- Step 9: Assess volume adjustment
- Step 10: Recalibrate VDOT if needed
- Step 11: Generate next week's workouts
- Step 12: Validate plan
- Step 13: Present to athlete
- Step 14: Save after approval

**Result**: Athlete experiences weekly check-ins as a single continuous conversation,
not separate "analysis" and "planning" sessions.

## Scenario 13: Detecting and Fixing Incomplete Multi-Sport Profile

**Context**: Coach notices ACWR seems unrealistically low despite athlete reporting fatigue.

**Why This Matters**:
- **Accurate load tracking**: Missing sports = systematic underestimation of training load
- **Injury prevention**: ACWR/CTL calculations require ALL activities, not just running
- **Intelligent scheduling**: Can't avoid conflicts without clear run-unavailable days
- **Complete athlete picture**: Need full context for personalized coaching

**Problem**: Athlete has significant non-running activities (e.g., climbing 40%, yoga 15%) but `other_sports = []` in profile.

**Impact**:
- CTL calculation misses ~40% of actual training load
- ACWR shows 0.9 (safe) when actual is 1.4 (danger zone)
- Weekly plans schedule hard runs on days athlete later can't train → injury risk
- Readiness scores show "fresh" when athlete is fatigued
- Total training days: 7 (4 runs + 3 climbs) but coach thinks it's only 4

### Workflow: Detect, Fix, Verify

**Step 1: Check profile**:
```bash
resilio profile get | jq '{running_priority, other_sports}'
# Returns: {"running_priority": "primary", "other_sports": []}
```

**Step 2: Check actual activity data**:
```bash
resilio profile analyze
# Returns: sport_percentages: {"climb": 42.0, "run": 28.0, "yoga": 15.0, ...}
```

**Step 3: Identify mismatch**:
```
Coach: "I see a mismatch. Your Strava shows:
- Climbing: 42% (39 sessions in last 120 days)
- Running: 28% (26 sessions)
- Yoga: 15% (14 sessions)

But your profile only tracks running. This means I'm missing 57% of your training
load in my fatigue calculations. That's why you feel tired but my metrics say you're fine."
```

**Step 4: Collect missing data**:
```bash
# Climbing (42% - significant)
resilio profile add-sport --sport climbing --frequency 3 --duration 120 --intensity hard

# Yoga (15% - just above threshold)
resilio profile add-sport --sport yoga --frequency 1 --duration 60 --intensity easy
```

**Step 5: Verify fix**:
```bash
resilio profile validate
# Should return: {"valid": true, "issues": []}

resilio status
# CTL/ACWR now reflect true load
```

**Step 6: Explain impact**:
```
Coach: "Now I see the full picture. Your true CTL is 56 (not 34), and ACWR is 1.38
Quick defs (first mention only): CTL is your long-term training load—think of it as your 6-week fitness trend. ACWR compares this week to your recent average; high values mean a sudden spike. For multi-sport athletes, these reflect total work across running + other sports.
(caution zone). This explains the fatigue. Let's adjust this week's plan to account
for your Monday climbing session - I'll move the tempo run to Wednesday instead."
```

### Key Teaching Points

**Data-driven validation**:
- Use `resilio profile analyze` to see actual sport distribution
- Sports >15% of activities should always be tracked
- `running_priority` determines conflict resolution, NOT whether to track sports

**When to check**:
- During first-session onboarding (Step 4f validation checkpoint)
- First weekly analysis if onboarding was incomplete
- Anytime athlete reports unexplained fatigue despite "good" metrics
- When ACWR seems unrealistically low for reported training load

**Common scenarios**:
1. **Primary runner who climbs**: Still need to track climbing for accurate CTL
2. **Equal priority athlete**: Obvious - track everything
3. **Athlete with variable other sports**: Even if days vary, track average duration/intensity

**Prevention**:
- Make Step 4f-validation mandatory in first-session workflow
- Run `resilio profile validate` before generating first macro plan
- Include validation reminder in weekly-analysis skill

## Scenario 14: Weather-Driven Workout Rescheduling

**Trigger**: (a) Athlete mentions weather or asks about swapping/moving a workout, OR (b) Coach is about to recommend specific days for quality or long workouts in the upcoming week (proactive check, even without an athlete prompt).

### Wrong Pattern

```
Athlete: "It's gorgeous out today — should I swap my long run to today instead of Saturday?"
Coach:   "What does Saturday look like weather-wise?"   ← ❌ asking the athlete what the coach can look up
```

### Correct Pattern

```
0. (If week-monday not yet known) resilio dates today → derive Monday from output
1. resilio weather week --start <current-week-monday>
2. Review daily forecast + any advisories for the week
3. Cross-reference with planned workouts (resilio week)
4. Synthesize and recommend proactively — no weather questions needed
```

### Example Response (correct)

> "I checked the forecast for your week. Today looks ideal — clear skies, low humidity. Saturday has rain and gusts expected in the afternoon. Moving the long run to today makes sense both for conditions and recovery timing. Let's do that."

### Key Rules

- **Never ask** "What does the weather look like?" or "Is it raining?" — the CLI answers this.
- **Never use WebSearch** for weather — `resilio weather week` uses a location-aware weather API already configured for the athlete.
- Always cross-reference weather with the current week's planned workouts before recommending a swap.
- If `resilio weather week` returns an error or location is not configured, proceed with training-logic-based scheduling and note: "I wasn't able to pull the forecast — let me know if conditions require adjusting the plan."
- For non-scheduling weather impacts (heat >28°C, high humidity, poor air quality, icy surfaces), adjust pace targets or session format rather than only swapping days.

## Tips for Effective Scenario-Based Coaching

1. **Always start with data**: Run `resilio status` or `resilio today` before giving advice
2. **Reference actual metrics**: Don't say "rest today" - say "Your ACWR is 1.5 (danger) and readiness is 35 (very low) - let's rest"
3. **Use AskUserQuestion for choices**: Present options with trade-offs, let athlete decide
4. **Explain the why**: Link recommendations to CTL, ACWR, readiness, or training phase
5. **Track patterns**: Use M13 memories to store recurring issues or preferences
