# Weekly Analysis: Comprehensive Training Review

## Overview

This skill provides complete weekly training analysis by:

1. Comparing planned vs. actual training (completion)
2. Validating intensity distribution (80/20 rule)
3. Analyzing multi-sport load breakdown
4. Detecting patterns and suggesting adaptations

**Key principle**: Use computational tools to calculate metrics; apply coaching judgment to interpret patterns.

**Communication guideline**: Present findings naturally. Say "Let me review your week" not "I'll use weekly-analysis." See AGENTS.md "Athlete-Facing Communication Guidelines."

**CLI execution rule**: Always attempt commands via the shell tool before
concluding they cannot be run. Never tell athletes to run commands in their
terminal, even if an initial attempt fails — try alternatives first
(see AGENTS.md "CLI Failure Rule").

**Conversational flow**: See AGENTS.md "Conversational Pacing" for guidance on when to wait for athlete responses vs. batching questions.

**Metric explainer rule (athlete-facing)**:
On first mention of any metric (VDOT/CTL/ATL/TSB/ACWR/Readiness/RPE), add a short, plain-language definition. If multiple metrics appear together, use a single "Quick defs" line. Do not repeat unless the athlete asks or seems confused. For multi-sport athletes, add a brief clause tying the metric to total work across running + other sports (e.g., climbing/cycling). Optionally add: "Want more detail, or is that enough for now?"

Use this exact VDOT explainer on first mention:
"VDOT is a running fitness score based on your recent race or hard-effort times. I use it to set your training paces so your running stays matched to your current fitness alongside your other sports."

One-line definitions for other metrics:
- CTL: "CTL is your long-term training load—think of it as your 6-week fitness trend."
- ATL: "ATL is your short-term load—basically how much you've trained in the past week."
- TSB: "TSB is freshness (long-term fitness minus short-term fatigue)."
- ACWR: "ACWR compares this week to your recent average; high values mean a sudden spike."
- Readiness: "Readiness is a recovery score—higher usually means you can handle harder work."
- RPE: "RPE is your perceived effort from 1–10."

## Workflow

### Step 0: Optional Quick Sync (for faster weekly analysis)

For faster weekly analysis, optionally sync only last week's data:

```bash
resilio sync --since 7d  # Quick sync (5-10 seconds vs 20-30 seconds for full sync)
```

**Note**: Without `--since`, `resilio sync` uses smart detection (incremental sync from last activity).

### Step 0.5: Plan Context (Automatic)

**Note**: `resilio week` now automatically includes planned workout details when a plan exists, so you don't need a separate command for plan checking.

The `planned_workouts_detail` field in the response contains:
- `null` if no plan exists → Use freeform analysis (Step 2 Option B)
- List of workouts if plan exists → Use adherence analysis (Step 2 Option A)

**Decision logic:**

| `planned_workouts_detail` | Interpretation | Next Step |
|---------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| `[{workouts...}]` | Structured plan active | → Step 2 Option A (adherence analysis) |
| `null` | No plan or freeform training | → Step 2 Option B (freeform analysis) |

**Key benefit**: You can't forget to check the plan—it's included automatically.

### Step 1: Get Weekly Summary

```bash
resilio week
```

**Parse key data**:

- Total planned vs. completed workouts
- Running volume vs. other activities
- CTL/ATL/TSB/ACWR/readiness changes

### Step 1.5: Week Completion Check

**Only applies when `planned_workouts_detail` is non-null (structured plan athletes).** If `planned_workouts_detail` is null (freeform, Step 0.5 → Option B), skip this check entirely — freeform athletes always proceed with full framing for all steps including Steps 8 and 9.

**For structured plan athletes:** filter `planned_workouts_detail` (from Step 0.5) to entries whose `date` field is strictly after today, then count. Use that count to determine framing:

- **Remaining = 0**: All scheduled workouts have passed — treat as end-of-week review. Run Steps 8 and 9 normally.
- **Remaining > 0**: Week is in progress — apply mid-week adjustments below.

**Mid-week adjustments (remaining > 0):**
- **Step 2**: Only collect activities from Monday through today. Workouts scheduled for dates **after today** are "not yet due" — list them in a separate "Upcoming" row, never as "Missed".
- **Completion denominator**: Count only workouts due on or before today. Report as "X/Y workouts completed so far (Z remaining this week)".
- **Step 8**: **Skip entirely** — do not log a partial week to the training log. An inline reminder is also placed at Step 8.
- **Step 9**: Skip the "plan next week" prompt — offer forward-looking guidance for the remaining days of this week instead (e.g., pacing, recovery, upcoming quality sessions).

---

### Step 2: Plan Adherence (if on plan) OR Activity Summary (if freeform)

#### Option A: Athlete on Structured Plan

Cross-reference planned workouts (from Step 0.5) with actual activities (from `resilio week`):

**⚠️ CRITICAL — Collect activities first, then match to plan**

Do NOT look for activities on specific planned dates. Instead:

**Step A — Collect ALL activities in the week window (Mon [date] through Sun [date])**
From `resilio week` → `completed_activities`: extract every activity in the week regardless
of sport type, regardless of what day it was planned.
Day-shifted sessions (e.g., Wednesday run done on Thursday, Thursday climb done on Friday)
are common and will be missed if you only check planned dates.

**Step B — Match each collected activity → closest planned workout:**
- ✅ **Match**: Type + volume aligns with a planned workout, same day
- ⚠️ **Day shift**: Aligns with a planned workout but on a different day — **count as completed**
- ⚠️ **Volume variance**: Matched workout but >15% over/under planned distance — flag, don't penalize
- ❌ **Missed**: Planned workout with NO matching activity found anywhere in the window of days already elapsed
- 🔜 **Not yet due**: Planned workout scheduled for a date **after today** (mid-week check-in only) — never count as missed
- ➕ **Extra**: Activity with no corresponding planned workout (cross-training, bonus run)

2. **Assess adherence:**
   - **Workout completion**: How many planned workouts were completed (count day-shifts as completed)
   - **Volume adherence**: For each planned activity, compare actual vs planned volume using the appropriate metric (running/cycling: km; climbing: duration or vertical meters) — flag if >115% or <80%
   - **Quality session check**: Were quality sessions (tempo, intervals, long run, hard climbing circuit, threshold ride) completed as prescribed? (highest priority)

3. **Flag critical patterns:**
   - ⚠️ Quality sessions missed or downgraded (tempo→easy, hard circuit→easy climb) — high priority
   - ⚠️ Key long session (long run, long ride, big climbing day) >20% over/under planned volume
   - ⚠️ Easy sessions at moderate pace/intensity (80/20 violation risk)
   - ⚠️ Unplanned high-load activities on rest days or before quality sessions

**Context matters:** A day shift (Wed→Thu) is usually fine. Volume variance needs coaching judgment — was it intentional, terrain-driven, or loss of discipline?

**Interpretation zones** (by completion rate):

- ≥90%: Excellent completion
- 70-89%: Good, minor adjustments needed
- 50-69%: Fair, discuss barriers
- <50%: Poor, major replanning needed

#### Option B: Freeform Training (No Structured Plan)

Focus on training quality without plan reference:

1. List all activities by date with sport/distance/duration
2. Compare volume to recent 4-week average
3. Assess frequency, sport distribution, consistency
4. Check if training supports stated goals

### Step 3: Verify Key Workouts with Lap Data (if structured workouts present)

**When reviewing structured workouts** (intervals, tempo, threshold), use lap data to verify execution quality:

```bash
resilio activity laps <activity-id>
```

**Quick checks** (see [lap_data_analysis.md](references/lap_data_analysis.md) for complete methodology):

1. **Warmup verification**: HR < 140, pace within easy range (avoid Fitzgerald's "moderate-intensity rut")
2. **Interval consistency**: Check pace variation across work intervals (CV < 3% = excellent)
3. **Tempo execution**: Pace within prescribed T-pace range, HR in threshold zone
4. **Pacing patterns**: Even pacing good, fade pattern = started too fast (FIRST's documented mistake)
5. **HR drift**: HR increasing at constant pace indicates heat stress or dehydration

**When lap data missing**: Fall back to aggregate metrics, note limitation in analysis.

**Common training mistakes detected via lap data** (Daniels, Pfitzinger, Fitzgerald, FIRST):
- Intervals too fast (defeats VO2max aerobic purpose)
- Easy runs at moderate intensity (compromises recovery)
- Tempo too fast (causes lactate accumulation vs. threshold stimulus)
- Starting long runs too fast (fade in later miles)

### Step 4: Intensity Distribution Analysis

First, export activities for analysis (if not already done):

```bash
resilio activity export --since 7d --out /tmp/week_activities.json
```

Then analyze intensity distribution:

```bash
resilio analysis intensity --activities /tmp/week_activities.json --days 7
```

**Returns**:

- `distribution`: % breakdown (low vs. moderate+high intensity)
- `compliance`: Meets 80/20 guideline?
- `polarization_score`: 0-100 (separation of easy from hard)
- `violations`: Specific issues

**Quick interpretation**:

- ≥80% low intensity: Compliant ✅ (80/20 target met)
- 75-79% low intensity: Acceptable but watch the trend ⚠️ (close — tighten easy pace)
- 60-74% low intensity: Moderate-intensity rut ❌ (gray zone problem — too hard to recover, not hard enough to adapt)
- <60% low intensity: Severe imbalance ❌❌ (injury/overtraining risk)

**For detailed 80/20 philosophy and violation handling**: See [references/intensity_guidelines.md](references/intensity_guidelines.md)

### Step 5: Multi-Sport Load Breakdown

```bash
resilio analysis load --activities /tmp/week_activities.json --days 7 --priority [PRIORITY]
```

**Returns**:

- `systemic_load_by_sport`: Cardio/whole-body load by activity
- `lower_body_load_by_sport`: Leg strain breakdown
- `priority_adherence`: How well schedule respected running priority
- `fatigue_flags`: Warning signals

**Quick zones** (for running PRIMARY):

- 60-70% running load: Good
- 50-60%: Fair
- <50%: Concerning

**For complete multi-sport load model and conflict handling**: See [references/multi_sport_balance.md](references/multi_sport_balance.md)

### Step 6: Pattern Detection

**Review activity notes for qualitative signals**:

```bash
# List activities with notes
resilio activity list --since 7d --has-notes

# Search for wellness signals
resilio activity search --query "tired fatigue flat heavy" --since 7d

# Search for pain/discomfort
resilio activity search --query "pain sore tight discomfort" --since 7d
```

**Patterns to identify**:

1. **Consistency**: Completed all weekday runs, skipped weekend (schedule conflict?)
2. **Intensity**: Easy runs too fast (RPE 6 instead of 4)
3. **Multi-sport**: Climbing sessions preceded by rest days (good planning)
4. **Volume**: Weekly volume increased 59% (too aggressive)
5. **Adaptation**: ACWR trended from 1.1 → 1.4 (approaching caution)

### Step 6.5: Capture Significant Patterns as Memories

**When a pattern appears 3+ times or is highly significant**, persist as memory:

```bash
# Consistency pattern
resilio memory add --type TRAINING_RESPONSE \
  --content "Consistently skips Tuesday runs due to work schedule" \
  --tags "schedule:tuesday,pattern:skip" \
  --confidence high

# Intensity pattern
resilio memory add --type TRAINING_RESPONSE \
  --content "Easy runs consistently 0.5 min/km too fast (RPE 6 instead of 4)" \
  --tags "intensity:easy,violation:pace" \
  --confidence high
```

**Guidelines**:

- Capture patterns with 3+ occurrences or high significance
- Use HIGH confidence for 3+, MEDIUM for 2 occurrences
- Tag for future retrieval

### Step 7: Synthesize and Communicate

**Structure**:

1. **Opening**: Overall summary + key achievement (positive first)
2. **Completion**: Planned vs. completed
3. **Intensity**: 80/20 compliance, violations if any
4. **Load**: Multi-sport breakdown, concerns
5. **Patterns**: Notable trends (positive and concerning)
6. **Metrics**: CTL/ATL/TSB/ACWR week-over-week changes
7. **Next Week**: Specific recommendations with concrete numbers

**Example opening**:

```
Great week! You completed 7/8 planned workouts (88% completion) and your CTL increased from 42 → 44.
```

**See complete worked examples**:

- [80/20 intensity violation](examples/example_week_80_20_violation.md)
- [Multi-sport conflict](examples/example_week_multi_sport.md)
- [Plan adherence comparison](#example-plan-adherence-comparison-week-2-of-marathon-plan) (inline below)

### Step 8: Log Weekly Summary to Training Log

> **Mid-week check-in**: Only run this step when remaining planned workouts = 0 (all scheduled workouts for this week have passed). See Step 1.5. Do not log a partial week.

**After presenting analysis** (completed weeks only), append summary to training log:

Create JSON with week summary:

```json
{
  "week_number": 1,
  "week_dates": "Jan 20-26",
  "planned_volume_km": 22.0,
  "actual_volume_km": 20.0,
  "adherence_pct": 91.0,
  "completed_workouts": [...],
  "key_metrics": {
    "ctl_start": 28,
    "ctl_end": 30,
    "tsb_start": 3,
    "tsb_end": 1,
    "acwr": 1.1
  },
  "coach_observations": "...",
  "milestones": [...]
}
```

**Append to log**:

```bash
resilio plan append-week --week 1 --from-json /tmp/week_1_summary.json
```

**Confirm with athlete**:
"Week summary logged. View anytime with: `resilio plan show-log`"

---

### Step 9: Plan Next Week (Weekly Executor Flow)

**After completing weekly analysis**, transition to planning next week's workouts for adaptive training.

**Ask athlete**:

```
"Your weekly review is complete. Ready to plan next week's workouts?"
```

**If athlete says yes**:

Run the executor flow:

1. `weekly-plan-generate` → creates weekly JSON + presents review in chat
2. Athlete approval (coach records it, then proceeds)
3. `weekly-plan-apply` → validates + persists approved week

**Context to pass to weekly-plan-generate** (as notes argument):

- Current week's completion rate
- ACWR and readiness scores
- Any illness/injury signals detected
- 80/20 intensity distribution compliance
- Notable patterns or concerns

**Example notes format**: `completion=88%, acwr=1.1, readiness=52, pattern: easy_runs_too_fast, no_injury_signals, intensity=82/18_compliant`

**If athlete says no** (wants to wait):

```
"No problem! When you're ready to plan next week, just let me know."
```

**Alternative**: If athlete only wants weekly analysis (not planning), you're done after Step 8.

---

## Integrated Workflow Example

**Natural coaching conversation**:

```
Athlete: "How was my week?"

Coach: [Runs Steps 1-8: Weekly Analysis]
  → 7/8 workouts completed (88% completion)
  → 82% easy, 18% hard (80/20 compliant ✓)
  → CTL increased 42 → 44 (healthy progression)
  → No concerning patterns

Coach: "Great week! You completed all runs except Saturday's easy run,
maintained excellent 80/20 intensity, and your CTL increased safely."

Coach: [Step 9] "Ready to plan next week's workouts?"

Athlete: "Yes"

Coach: [Runs weekly executor flow]
  → weekly-plan-generate creates Week 2 plan review + JSON
  → Presents plan with rationale based on this week's analysis
  → weekly-plan-apply saves after athlete approval

Coach: "Week 2 plan saved! You'll see workouts starting Monday."
```

### Example: Plan Adherence Comparison (Week 2 of Marathon Plan)

**From `resilio plan week`** (planned):
- Mon Feb 2: 8km easy (RPE 4, 6:19-6:49/km)
- Wed Feb 4: 7km easy (RPE 4, 6:19-6:49/km)
- Sun Feb 8: 12km long run (RPE 5, 6:20-6:49/km)

**From `resilio week`** (actual):
| Planned | Actual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Mon: 8km easy | Mon: 8.5km run, 53 min, HR 145.8 | ✅ Match |
| Wed: 7km easy | Thu: 6.6km run, 39 min, HR 145.4 | ⚠️ Day shift (Wed→Thu) |
| Sun: 12km long | Sun: 15.5km run, 96 min, HR 148.8 | ⚠️ Volume +29% |
| — | Mon: 80 min climb (RPE 4) | ➕ Extra (cross-training) |

**Coach summary**: "You completed all 3 planned runs — great consistency! Two things to discuss: Sunday's long run was 29% over target (15.5 vs 12km). Was that intentional? In base phase, I'd prefer staying closer to plan to build gradually. Also, the Wednesday→Thursday shift is totally fine — was that a schedule thing?"

## Quick Decision Trees

### Q: Adherence <50%

1. Don't criticize - investigate barriers
2. Assess cause: External (life stress), plan mismatch, motivation, physical
3. Adapt: Adjust current week using `weekly-plan-generate` + `weekly-plan-apply` (target current week)

### Q: Intensity violates 80/20 (moderate-intensity rut)

1. Show distribution (e.g., 65/35 instead of 80/20)
2. Explain gray zone problem (RPE 5-6 = too hard to recover, not hard enough to adapt)
3. Provide specific pace targets from VDOT
4. Next week: Verify compliance

**For detailed intensity violation handling**: See [references/intensity_guidelines.md](references/intensity_guidelines.md)

### Q: Multi-sport conflict (e.g., climbing comp → next-day long run)

1. Analyze systemic vs. lower-body load
2. Explain impact (systemic fatigue even though legs okay)
3. Present options: Move long run, adjust expectations, or skip/replace
4. Capture pattern as memory

**For complete multi-sport scenarios**: See [references/multi_sport_balance.md](references/multi_sport_balance.md)

### Q: Volume increased too quickly (e.g., +60%)

1. Show violation of 10% rule
2. Connect to ACWR spike
3. Recommend pull-back for next week
4. Validate with: `resilio guardrails progression --previous [X] --current [Y]`

### Q: Athlete wants to increase despite concerns (ACWR 1.35)

1. Explain leading indicator (predicts injury before symptoms)
2. Offer compromise: Maintain this week, reassess next week
3. Balance motivation with objective risk

### Q: Athlete completed MORE workouts than planned

**Investigate:**
1. Extra activities: same sport or cross-training?
   - Same sport on rest day → recovery deficit risk, check ACWR
   - Cross-training → assess systemic load impact via multi-sport analysis
2. Did extra activities fall on rest days or before quality sessions?
   - Before quality session → may have compromised quality workout
   - On rest day → flag recovery importance
3. Were extra activities high-intensity or easy?
   - High-intensity → 80/20 violation risk
   - Easy → generally acceptable if ACWR safe

**Approach:** Celebrate enthusiasm, explain "more ≠ better" (adaptation during rest), suggest channeling energy into quality execution of planned sessions.

## Quick Pitfalls Checklist

Before sending weekly review, verify:

0. ✅ **Checked for active plan** - Ran `resilio plan week` before analyzing
0b. ✅ **Checked all week days** — Collected activities from full Mon-Sun window before matching (not just planned days)
1. ✅ **Started with positive** - Not leading with criticism
2. ✅ **Contextualized completion** - Investigated why low (if applicable)
3. ✅ **Flagged 80/20 violations** - Checked intensity distribution
4. ✅ **Connected multi-sport dots** - Showed total load across activities
5. ✅ **Specific recommendations** - Concrete numbers, not vague advice

**For detailed pitfall explanations with examples**: See [references/pitfalls.md](references/pitfalls.md)
