# First Session: Athlete Onboarding

## Overview

This skill guides complete athlete onboarding from authentication to goal setting. The workflow ensures historical data is available before profile setup, enabling data-driven questions instead of generic prompts.

**Prerequisites**: This skill assumes your environment is ready (Python 3.11+, `resilio` CLI available). If you haven't set up your environment yet, use the `complete-setup` skill first to install Python and the package.

**Communication guideline**: When talking to athletes, never mention skills, slash commands, or internal tools. Say "Let me help you get started" not "I'll run the first-session skill." See AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md "Athlete-Facing Communication Guidelines."

**Why historical data matters**: ask "I see you average 35km/week over the last X weeks/months - should we maintain this?" instead of "How much do you run?" (no context).

**Metric explainer rule (athlete-facing)**:
On first mention of any metric (VDOT/CTL/ATL/TSB/ACWR/Readiness/RPE), add a short, plain-language definition. If multiple metrics appear together, use a single "Quick defs" line. Do not repeat unless the athlete asks or seems confused. For multi-sport athletes, add a brief clause tying the metric to total work across running + other sports (e.g., climbing/cycling). Optionally add: "Want more detail, or is that enough for now?"

Use this exact VDOT explainer on first mention:
"VDOT is a running fitness score based on your recent race or hard-effort times. I use it to set your training paces so your running stays matched to your current fitness alongside your other sports."

One-line definitions for other metrics:
- CTL: "CTL is your long-term training load—think of it as your 6-week fitness trend."
- ATL: "ATL is your short-term load—basically how much you've trained in the past week."
- TSB: "TSB is freshness (long-term fitness minus short-term fatigue)."
- ACWR: "ACWR compares this week to your recent average; high values mean a sudden spike."
- Readiness: "Readiness is a recovery score—higher usually means you can handle harder work."
- RPE: "RPE is your perceived effort from 1–10."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check Authentication (CRITICAL - Always First)

Historical activity data from Strava is essential for intelligent coaching. Without it, you're coaching blind with CTL=0.

```bash
resilio auth status
```

**Handle exit codes**:

- **Exit code 0**: Authenticated → Proceed to Step 2
- **Exit code 3**: Expired/missing → Guide OAuth flow
- **Exit code 2**: Config missing → Run `resilio init` first

**If config is missing or credentials are empty**:

1. Run `resilio init` to create `config/secrets.local.yaml` (if missing).
2. Read `config/secrets.local.yaml` and verify `strava.client_id` and `strava.client_secret` are present.
3. If either is missing or still the placeholder:
   - Explain FIRST (before opening anything):
     "To connect your Strava data, I need two credentials from your Strava API settings:
      a **Client ID** (a short number) and a **Client Secret** (a long alphanumeric string).
      I'm about to open your Strava API settings page in the browser.
      Once it opens: scroll down to find 'My API Application' — you'll see Client ID and Client Secret listed there.
      Copy both values and paste them here."
   - THEN auto-open: run `open https://www.strava.com/settings/api` via Bash
   - Fallback: "If your browser didn't open: https://www.strava.com/settings/api"
4. Write the values into `config/secrets.local.yaml` under:
   ```yaml
   strava:
     client_id: "..."
     client_secret: "..."
   ```
5. Confirm: "Saved locally. I’ll use these for authentication going forward."

**If auth expired/missing** (exit code 3):

1. Explain why: "I need Strava access to provide intelligent coaching based on actual training patterns."
2. Generate URL: `resilio auth url`
3. Auto-open: run `open <URL>` (Bash), then show URL as fallback; say "Your browser is opening to Strava — authorize and paste the code here"
4. Wait for athlete to provide code
5. Exchange: `resilio auth exchange --code CODE`
6. Confirm: "Great! I can now access your training history."

**For complete OAuth flow and troubleshooting**: See [references/authentication.md](references/authentication.md)

---

### Step 2: Sync Activities

```bash
resilio sync  # First-time: targets up to 365 days automatically
```

**Operational monitoring**:
- Use `resilio sync --status` to check if sync is actively running, lock health, heartbeat progress, and persisted resume cursor state.
- Do not use `ps` polling or ad-hoc process grep to infer sync status.

**Post-sync overview (MANDATORY)**
After every `resilio sync`, give the athlete a brief overview. Use the sync command output (JSON envelope or success message); run `resilio profile analyze` to get the exact date range.

Include:

1. **Number of activities synced** (from sync result: `activities_imported` or success message).
2. **Time span covered** (weeks or months). Always compute from `resilio profile analyze` → `data_window_days`, `synced_data_start`, `synced_data_end`.
3. **Rate limit status** (if hit): Explain that the athlete has imported sufficient data for baseline metrics.

Keep the overview to 2–4 sentences. Do not skip this step.

**Never claim** "last 365 days" unless `data_window_days >= 360` and no rate-limit error occurred.
If a rate limit was hit, the summary must explicitly say the history is partial and can be resumed later.

**Required summary pattern** (adapt wording, keep facts):
"Imported X activities spanning N days (YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD). If rate limited: 'Sync paused due to Strava rate limits, so this is a partial year. We can resume in ~15 minutes.'"

**Note**: Activities are stored in monthly folders (`data/activities/YYYY-MM/*.yaml`). See [cli_data_structure.md](../../../docs/coaching/cli/cli_data_structure.md) for details on data organization.

**What this provides**:

- Up to 365 days (52 weeks) of activity history (Greedy Sync)
- CTL/ATL/TSB calculated from historical load
- Activity patterns (training days, volume, sport distribution)

**Handling Greedy Sync & Rate Limits (IMPORTANT)**:
The sync process is "greedy"—it fetches the most recent activities first and proceeds backwards until it hits the 52-week limit OR the Strava API rate limit (100 requests / 15 min).

**EXPECTED**: The initial sync may hit rate limits for many athletes with regular training. This is normal, designed behavior.

**Why**: Fetching 365 days typically requires 200-400 API requests. Strava limits apps to 100 requests per 15 minutes. The system handles this gracefully by pausing and resuming.

**Reference**: See [Strava Rate Limits](https://developers.strava.com/docs/rate-limits/) - 100 requests/15min, 1000 requests/day.

**If rate limit hit (~100 requests):**

Present this choice with coaching expertise:

"I've imported your last [X] activities (about [Y] months). The sync paused due to Strava's rate limit (100 requests per 15 minutes) - this is expected for initial syncs.

Your current data is sufficient to establish baseline metrics (CTL, fitness level), so you have two options:

**Options:**
1. **Continue with current data (recommended for getting started)** - Enough for reliable baseline
2. **Wait 15 minutes and sync more** - To get complete year of history

We can always sync more history later. What would you prefer?"

**If athlete chooses option 2:**
- Wait 15 minutes for rate limit reset
- Run `resilio sync` again (will automatically resume from where it left off)
- Repeat until athlete is satisfied or full year is synced

**For very active athletes** (7+ activities/week):
- Multiple 15-minute waits expected (3-5 pauses typical)
- Total sync time: 45-60 minutes including waits
- Rare edge case: May approach daily limit (1,000 requests) - if so, continue next day

**Coaching tip**: For very active athletes, set expectation upfront: "Your training volume means the initial sync will take 45-60 minutes with several 15-minute pauses. Totally normal - Strava limits how fast we can fetch data."

**Success message**: "Imported X activities (covering approximately Y weeks). Your CTL is Z."

---

### Step 3: Review Historical Data

**Before asking profile questions, understand what the data shows.**

```bash
resilio status                # Baseline metrics (CTL/ATL/TSB/ACWR)
resilio week                  # Recent training patterns
resilio profile analyze       # Profile suggestions from synced data
```

**Activity analysis commands** (for workout verification):
```bash
resilio activity list --since 7d        # List recent activities
resilio activity laps <activity-id>     # View lap-by-lap breakdown (for workout verification)
```

Lap data enables the AI coach to verify workout execution quality and detect common pacing mistakes.

**Extract from analysis**:

- `max_hr_observed`: Suggests max HR
- `weekly_run_km_avg`: Average weekly volume
- `sport_distribution`: Multi-sport breakdown
- `activity_gaps`: Potential injury/illness breaks

**Use data to inform profile setup** - reference actual numbers.

---

### Step 4: Profile Setup (Natural Conversation)

**Use natural conversation for text/number inputs. Use chat-based numbered options for decisions with distinct trade-offs (conflict policy, goal feasibility).**

**For complete field-by-field guidance**: See [references/profile_setup_workflow.md](references/profile_setup_workflow.md)

#### Multi-Sport Branching Logic

**Check sport distribution** from `resilio profile analyze` → `sport_percentages`:

- **If >1 sport at >15%**: Use full sequence (steps 4a-4d-4e-4f)
- **If mostly running (>80%)**: Use standard sequence (steps 4a-4d-4e), add 4f only if athlete reports regular non-running commitments

This ensures we understand the athlete's complete training picture before asking about constraints.

#### Quick Overview (Multi-Sport Sequence)

**Step 4a - Basic Info**: Name, age, max HR (reference Strava peak), resting HR, running experience (years), weather location

- Ask explicitly: "Where do you usually train? I'll use this to pull weekly weather context when designing your training plans — so I can factor in heat, wind, or storms before assigning quality sessions."
- Capture as a location string suitable for weather lookup (e.g., "Lyon, France")
- If the athlete travels frequently, note their primary base location and mention they can update it later for travel weeks
- If location geocoding fails during planning, let the athlete know the weather lookup was skipped and they can set a more specific location (e.g., "Paris, France" instead of "Paris")

**CRITICAL**: After collecting running_experience_years in conversation, you MUST persist it to the profile immediately after profile creation (Step 4e):

```bash
# After resilio profile create, if running_experience_years was collected:
resilio profile set --running-experience-years <value>
```

This ensures the value is stored in profile.yaml and available for future coaching decisions.

**Why this matters**: "I need your complete training picture. Climbing loads your cardiovascular system even though it doesn't stress your legs the same way. If I ignore it, I'll over-prescribe running and you'll burn out."

**Step 4b - Injury History**: Search activities for gaps/pain mentions → Store in memory system with tags

- Use `resilio activity search --query "pain injury sore"` to detect signals
- Store each injury: `resilio memory add --type INJURY_HISTORY --content "..." --tags "body:knee,status:resolved"`

**Step 4c - Sport Priority**: Reference `resilio profile analyze` sport distribution

- Options: `"running"` (PRIMARY), `"equal"` (EQUAL), other sport name (SECONDARY)

**Step 4d - Conflict Policy** (from sport picture): Use chat-based numbered options (trade-offs with distinct options)

- Options: Ask each time | Primary sport wins | Running goal wins
- Context: "Your week has climbing 3x/week and yoga 2x/week. When training conflicts arise..."

**Step 4e - Create Profile**:

```bash
resilio profile create --name "Alex" --age 32 --max-hr 190 --run-priority equal --conflict-policy ask_each_time --weather-location "Lyon, France"
```

**Step 4f - Other Sports Collection** (AFTER profile creation):

- Check distribution: `resilio profile analyze` → sport_percentages
- Collect ALL sports >15%
- **Frequency + unavailable days model**:
  - **Option 1**: Frequency only → `resilio profile add-sport --sport climbing --frequency 3 --duration 120`
  - **Option 2**: Frequency + unavailable days → `resilio profile add-sport --sport climbing --frequency 3 --unavailable-days tue,thu --duration 120`

**Temporary break handling**:
- If athlete pauses a sport to focus on running or due to injury/illness:
  - Pause: `resilio profile pause-sport --sport climbing --reason focus_running`
  - Resume later: `resilio profile resume-sport --sport climbing`

**Coaching conversation**:
- "How many times per week do you climb? Any days you can’t do it?"
- If athlete says "3 times a week, days vary" → Use `--frequency 3`
- If athlete says "I can’t climb Sundays" → Add `--unavailable-days sunday`

**Step 4f-validation - Data Alignment**:

- Verify: `resilio profile validate`
- Check: All sports >15% from analyze are in other_sports
- Only proceed when alignment confirmed

**Step 4.5 - Personal Bests**:

- Ask directly: "What are your PBs for 5K, 10K, half, marathon?"
- Enter each: `resilio profile set-pb --distance 10k --time 42:30 --date 2023-06-15`
- After sync, cross-check standout activities conversationally: "I see a strong 43:15 10K on Dec 15 — was that a race?" If yes, update PB if faster.
- Verify: `resilio profile get` (PBs section)

**Step 4g - Communication Preferences** (optional):

- Offer customization: "Tailor coaching style or use defaults?"
- If yes: Detail level, coaching style, intensity metric
- If no: "I'll use moderate detail, supportive tone, pace-based workouts"

See [profile_setup_workflow.md](references/profile_setup_workflow.md) for detailed workflows, decision trees, validation steps, and common scenarios.

---

### Step 5: Goal Setting

**Questions** (natural conversation):

- "What are you training for?"
- "When is your race?" (date)
- "What's your goal time?" (optional)

```bash
resilio goal set --type half_marathon --date 2026-06-01
# Optional: --time "1:30:00" if specific goal
```

**Goal types**: `5k`, `10k`, `half_marathon`, `marathon`

---

### Step 5.5: Validate Goal Feasibility

**CRITICAL: Always validate goal against current fitness before committing to plan.**

Run `resilio performance baseline` and `resilio goal set` (which includes automatic feasibility validation). Respond based on the verdict (VERY_REALISTIC → UNREALISTIC).

**For complete verdict handling, coaching responses, and edge cases**: See [references/goal_validation.md](references/goal_validation.md)

**Decision point**: Wait for athlete confirmation before proceeding to Step 6.

---

### Step 6: Running Constraints (Subtractive Model)

**CRITICAL: Discuss constraints AFTER other sports are configured. This step is now informed by the athlete's complete training picture.**

**Context-aware conversation**: For multi-sport athletes, reference their other sports when discussing constraints.

Example: "Your week has climbing 3x/week and yoga 2x/week. Given your half marathon goal, 3 quality run days fits well alongside everything else. Does that sound manageable?"

**Questions** (natural conversation):

1. **Run frequency (minimum)**: "What's the minimum days per week you can commit to running?" (2-3 typical)

   - Store as: `--min-run-days N`

2. **Run frequency (maximum)**: "How many days per week can you realistically run?" (3-6 typical)

   - Store as: `--max-run-days N`

3. **Unavailable days (subtractive model)**: "Are there any days you absolutely CANNOT run?"

   - **NEW APPROACH**: Ask for exceptions, not exhaustive lists
   - **If athlete says "No" or "All days work"**: No unavailable days (default)
   - **If athlete says "Tuesdays and Thursdays - that's climbing night"**: Mark those as unavailable
   - **Example**: "Cannot run Tue/Thu" → `--unavailable-days "tuesday,thursday"`
   - **Default is empty** - only specify days that are UNAVAILABLE

4. **Session duration**: "What's the longest time for a long run?" (90-180 min typical)

   - Store as: `--max-session-minutes N`

**Store constraints**:

```bash
# Example: Cannot run Tue/Thu (climbing nights), 3-4 days/week, max 120 min sessions
resilio profile set --min-run-days 3 --max-run-days 4 \
  --unavailable-days "tuesday,thursday" \
  --max-session-minutes 120
```

**If athlete says "all days work"** (no unavailable days):

```bash
# No need to specify --unavailable-days (defaults to empty - no unavailable days)
resilio profile set --min-run-days 3 --max-run-days 4 --max-session-minutes 120
```

**Auto-derive suggestion**: If the athlete says they cannot run on certain days because of other sports, set those as `--unavailable-days` for running. But don’t assume - some athletes can do both on the same day.

---

### Step 7: Suggest Next Steps

**After onboarding complete**:

```
"Great! Your profile is set up. CTL is 44 (solid recreational fitness) with half marathon goal June 1st.

That's 20 weeks. Based on your fitness and constraints (4 run days/week, climbing Tuesdays), I recommend designing a training plan.

Would you like me to create a personalized plan now?"
```

**If yes**: Run `vdot-baseline-proposal`, then `macro-plan-create`

---

## Quick Decision Trees

### Q: Athlete has no recent Strava data

**Scenario**: Sync returns <10 activities in 365 days / 52 weeks

**Response**: "I see minimal recent Strava activity. No problem - we'll start from scratch. CTL starts at 0, building volume gradually from conservative baseline."

**Adjustments**: Ask directly "How much have you been running weekly?" (no data to reference)

### Q: Athlete doesn't have a Strava account

**Response**: Strava authentication is required. Guide the athlete to create a free account at strava.com before proceeding. They'll need to record at least a few activities before we can provide data-driven coaching.

### Q: Multiple sports with complex schedule

**Approach**:

1. Identify sport frequency and hard no-go days
2. Map running around unavailable days
3. Consider lower-body load: "Climbing doesn't impact legs, cycling does"
4. Set conflict policy carefully (likely `ask_each_time`)

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Asking for data already available

❌ **Bad**: "How much do you run per week?"
✅ **Good**: "I see you average 22.5 km/week - maintain this or adjust?"

**Always check `resilio profile analyze` first**

### 2. Using chat-based numbered options for free-form text

❌ **Bad**: chat-based numbered options for "What's your name?"
✅ **Good**: Natural conversation for all text/number inputs

**chat-based numbered options ONLY for decisions with distinct trade-offs (conflict policy, goal feasibility)**

### 3. Skipping auth check

❌ **Bad**: Proceeding to profile without auth
✅ **Good**: Always `resilio auth status` first

**Auth must be first** - historical data enables intelligent setup

### 4. Asking the athlete to edit YAML manually

❌ **Bad**: "Open config/secrets.local.yaml and edit it."
✅ **Good**: Ask for Client ID/Secret in chat and write them locally.

### 5. Not discussing constraints before planning

❌ **Bad**: Creating plan without knowing schedule
✅ **Good**: Ask run days, duration, other sports BEFORE planning

**Constraints shape entire plan**

### 6. Generic injury questions

❌ **Bad**: "Any injuries?" (no context)
✅ **Good**: "I see 2-week gap in November with CTL drop - injury-related?"

**Use activity gaps as conversation starters**

### 7. Not asking for PBs directly

❌ **Bad**: Only looking at synced data for PBs (misses pre-Strava performances)
✅ **Good**: Ask directly for PBs first, then cross-check synced data conversationally

**Ask first, verify second** - Most runners know their PBs. Sync data is supplementary, not primary.

---

## Success Criteria

**Onboarding complete when**:

1. ✅ Authentication successful (`resilio auth status` returns 0)
2. ✅ Activities synced (max 365 days / 52 weeks target)
3. ✅ Profile created (name, age, max HR, conflict policy)
   3.5. ✅ Running experience collected (years, or marked as unknown)
4. ✅ Injury history recorded in memory system (if applicable)
5. ✅ Personal bests captured (PBs added via `resilio profile set-pb`)
6. ✅ Goal set (race type, date)
7. ✅ Constraints discussed (run days, duration, other sports)
8. ✅ Other sports data collected (all sports >15% from resilio profile analyze)
9. ✅ Data validation passed (other_sports matches Strava distribution)
10. ✅ Ready for plan generation

**Quality checks**:

- All data referenced from `resilio profile analyze`
- chat-based numbered options used ONLY for decisions with distinct trade-offs (conflict policy, goal feasibility)
- Natural conversation for text/number inputs
- Injury history in memory system with proper tags
- Multi-sport athletes have other_sports populated based on actual Strava data
- Validation checkpoint prevents progression until data is complete
- Coach explains WHY other_sports matters (load calc, not just priority)

**Handoff**: "Would you like me to design your training plan now?" → Run `vdot-baseline-proposal` → `macro-plan-create`
